# Projet-Compilation-M1

Project imported from https://services.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/projet/git/projcompilfbnmbm accomplished in first year of master's degree. We was originally three to realize this project, but I made it alone. The goal was to implement a pseudo code compilator (simplified) in Java using Jflex and Cup.
